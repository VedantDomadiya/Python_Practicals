1. Write a Python program to create a calculator class. Include methods for basic
arithmetic operations.
2. Write a Python program to create a class representing a Circle. Include methods to
calculate its area and perimeter.
3. Write a Python program to create a class that represents a shape. Include methods
to calculate its area and perimeter. Implement subclasses for different shapes like
circle, triangle, and square.
4. Write a python program to implement method overloading. If there is no argument
then it returns 0. And, If we have one argument then it returns the square of the value
and assumes you are computing the area of a square. Also, if we have two
arguments then it returns the product of the two values and assumes you are
computing the area of a rectangle. If we have three arguments then it should return
the area of the triangle.

5. Write a program to implement an abstract method.
  1. Create an abstract class compute
  2. Declare an abstract method calculate
  3. Now in concrete class Square write the definition of calculate method which will
  calculate the square of a given number.
  4. Now in concrete class Cube write the definition of calculate method which will
  calculate the cube of a given number.

6 . Write a python program to implement operator overloading for adding two objects.
7. Explain Encapsulation with the help of an example. (Public private and protected access
modifiers)
