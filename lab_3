Q.1 Write a program that prompts the user to input two integers and outputs the largest.

Q.2 Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and determines whether it is
positive, negative, or zero. The program should print "Positive" if the number is greater than
0, "Negative" if the number is less than 0, and "Zero" if the number is 0.

Q.3 Write a program that prompts the user to enter their age and prints the corresponding age
group. The program should use the following age groups:
0-12: Child
13-19: Teenager
20-59: Adult
60 and above: Senior Citizen

Q.4 Write a program that prompts the user to input a number from 1 to 7. The program
should display the corresponding day for the given number. For example, if the user types 1,
the output should be Sunday. If the user types 7, the output should be Saturday. If the number
is not between 1 to 7 users should get an error message as shown in sample output.

Q.5 The marks obtained by a student in 3 different subjects are input by the user. Your
program should calculate the average of subjects and display the grade. The student gets a
grade as per the following rules:
Average Grade
90-100 A
80-89 B
70-79 C
60-69 D
0-59 F

Q.6. The roots of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, a â‰  0 are given by the following
formula:

In this formula, the term b
2
- 4ac is called the discriminant. If b
2
- 4ac = 0, then the equation

has two equal roots.
If b
2
- 4ac > 0, the equation has two real roots. If b
2
- 4ac < 0, the equation has two complex

roots.
Write a program that prompts the user to input the value of a (the coefficient of x
2
), b (the
coefficient of x), and c (the constant term) and outputs the roots of the quadratic equation.

Q.7. Write a program that prompts the user to enter three numbers and sorts them in
ascending order. The program should print the sorted numbers.

Q.8. Write a program that prompts the user to input three integers and outputs the largest.

Q.12 Write a program that prompts the user to input a character and determine the character
is vowel or consonant.

Q.13 Write a program that prompts the user to input a year and determine whether the year is
a leap year or not.
Leap Years are any year that can be evenly divided by 4. A year that is evenly divisible by
100 is a leap year only if it is also evenly divisible by 400. Example :
1992 Leap Year
2000 Leap Year
1900 NOT a Leap Year
1995 NOT a Leap Year

Q.14 Write a program that prompts the user to input number of calls and calculate the
monthly telephone bills as per the following rule:
Minimum Rs. 200 for up to 100 calls.
Plus Rs. 0.60 per call for next 50 calls.
Plus Rs. 0.50 per call for next 50 calls.
Plus Rs. 0.40 per call for any call beyond 200 calls.
