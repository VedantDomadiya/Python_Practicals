1. Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program
should calculate the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered.
For example, if the user enters 20, the loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
20.

2. Two numbers are entered through the keyboard. Write a program to find the
value of one number raised to the power of another.

3. Write a program that prompts the user to input a number and reverse its
digits. For example, the reverse of 12345 is 54321; reverse of 5600 is 65.

4. Compute the sum up to n terms in the series: 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 -... 1/n,
where n is a positive integer and input by user.

5. Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess
what the number is. If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the
program should display "Too high, try again." If the user's guess is lower than
the random number, the program should display "Too low, try again." The
program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the
random number. Program should count and display the number of tries to win
the game.

6. Write a function find_max that accepts three numbers as arguments and
returns the largest number among three. Write another function main, in
main() function accept three numbers from the user and call find_max.

7. Write the definition of a function zero_ending(scores) to add all those values
in the list of scores, which are ending with zero and display the sum.

8. Write a method in python to display the elements of list thrice if it is a number
and display the element terminated with ‘#’ if it is not a number.

9. For a given list of values in descending order, write a method in python to
search for a value with the help of Binary Search method. The method should
return the position of the value and should return -1 if the value is not present
in the list.

10.Write a function half_and_half that takes in a list and change the list such that
the elements of the second half are now in the first half. For example, if the
size of list is even and content of list is as follows :
my_liist = [10,20,30,40,50,60]
The output should be
[40,50,60,10,20,30]
if the size of list is odd and content of list is as follows :
my_liist = [10,20,30,40,50,60,70]
The output should be
[50,60,70,40,10,20,30]

11. Write a recursive function that accepts an integer argument in n. This function
returns the nth Fibonacci number. Call the function to print fibonacci
sequences.

12.Write a recursive function that calculates the sum of first n natural numbers.

13.Write a Recursive function in python BinarySearch(Arr, L, R, X) to search the
given element X to be searched from the List Arr having R elements, where L
represents lower bound and R represents the upper bound.
